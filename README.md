# ifview
**ifview** (*"interface view"*) provides a cleaner, enriched visualization of network interfaces on Linux. It leverages **ip** tools and the **rich** library to produce an attractive, colorized table displaying network interfaces, IP addresses, MAC addresses, state, MTU, and physical NIC models.

## Features
- Tabular and colorized output for easy readability
- Displays interface state, MAC, IP addresses, MTU
- Adds detected NIC models to the output for deeper hardware insight
- Simple and direct: no heavy dependencies beyond Python 3 and `rich`
